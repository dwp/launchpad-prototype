        <br>
        We have received the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) application you started for James Kang.

        <br>  
        For the next stage of the PIP application, we will ask about their daily living and mobility needs to help us make our decision.
        <br>
        <br>
        If we need more information after you have submitted the application, we may invite you to an assessment.
        
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to fill in the application by</h2>

      <p>You will need to answer all the questions and upload any 
        evidence you have by: <b>10 June 2025</b></p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need more time </h3>
      <p>If you need more time to fill in the form, contact us. Our contact details are at the end of this email.
If you have not submitted the application by the return date, and you have not let us know, we may end the PIP application.

      <br>

        <br>
        We will guide you through what you need to do at each step, but it will be useful to have these ready:

          <li>how their health condition or disability affects their daily life</li>
            <li>a list of things they need help with or find difficult</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can also gather information to help you fill in the form and it can be uploaded as evidence to support your answers.
              <br>
              <br>
              You do not need to answer all the questions in one go. You can save the application and return to it later by signing back in.
