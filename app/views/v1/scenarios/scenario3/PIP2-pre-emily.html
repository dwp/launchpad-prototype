        How Emily's health conditions or disabilities affect them</h1>

      <p>This part of the PIP application is about Emilyâ€™s health conditions or disabilities and how they affect them.</p>
     

          <p> You will be asked questions about their ability to carry out everyday activities. Your answers will help us assess their entitlement to PIP. You can also upload evidence to support the application.</p>
          <p>Take your time and describe all the help they need. You do not have to answer all the questions in one go. You can save your progress at any point and continue later.</p>
    
        </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

      <p>You will need:</p>
